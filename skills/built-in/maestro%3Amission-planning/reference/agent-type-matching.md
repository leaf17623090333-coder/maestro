# Agent Type Matching: Feature to Executor

This is the third step of mission planning. You have a decomposed plan with milestones and features from Step 2. You need to assign each feature to an agent type that can actually execute it.

Agents are the external processes that implement features. Maestro is the conductor — it holds the score, drafts the next handoff, and validates results, but it does not write code itself. The four agent types below cover every real execution pattern.

## The four agent types

**`codex-cli`** — mechanical implementation against a spec. Cheap, fast, runs in a fresh context with no carryover. No judgment, no taste, no pushback. Best when the feature reads like a to-do list: the decision work is already done and someone just needs to type it in. If a feature would benefit from "what if we did X instead," `codex-cli` is the wrong choice — it will do exactly what the prompt says, even when the prompt is wrong.

**`claude-code`** — ambiguous or heavy-lift work that needs judgment. Expensive, slower, brings taste and pushback. Best when the feature has multiple valid approaches, when requirements are loose, when the change touches architecture, or when a reviewer has to think like a senior engineer. Also the right choice when the work is small but the blast radius is large (security, auth, migration paths).

**`subagent`** — native Claude Code Task tool. Shares the parent context, so it can see what the parent has already read without re-exploring. Fast and cheap for research and exploration. Best for "survey the codebase for X" or "find every caller of Y" — things where the answer is discoverable from existing files and the parent wants a summary back, not a patch. Not appropriate for multi-hour implementation work; subagents lose coherence as their scope grows.

**`human`** — ideation, approval, trust calls, final taste judgments. The only agent type that can say "this is ugly, do it differently" without a formal rubric. Best for brainstorm opening, final go/no-go decisions, and any milestone where the question is "is this what I actually want?" not "does this match the spec?"

## Decision table

| Feature characteristic | Agent type |
|---|---|
| Mechanical code following a spec | `codex-cli` |
| Bug fix with clear reproduction and fix direction | `codex-cli` |
| Exploratory research across the codebase | `subagent` |
| Enumerating callers, references, or patterns | `subagent` |
| Architectural decision with multiple valid options | `claude-code` |
| New feature with ambiguous requirements | `claude-code` |
| Refactor that touches cross-cutting concerns | `claude-code` |
| Code review of a generator's output | `claude-code` (different instance than generator) |
| Final go/no-go decision on a milestone | `human` |
| Brainstorming a raw idea into a plan | `human` + `claude-code` together |

## The "different instance" rule

If a milestone profile is `code-review` or `plan-review`, the reviewer must be a different instance than whatever produced the artifact being reviewed. A fresh `claude-code` session reviewing another `claude-code` session's code is fine. The same session reviewing its own work is not.

Self-review is pathologically lenient. The Anthropic harness-engineering article calls this out directly: models are strongly biased toward approving their own output because their working memory still holds the justifications for every decision they made. A fresh reviewer does not carry those justifications, and will notice problems the generator rationalized away. Always spawn a new instance for review milestones.

## Worked examples

`codex-cli` — matches:
- "Add a `--format json` flag to `maestro mission list` that emits the existing data through `JSON.stringify`." Clear spec, clear location, zero decisions left.
- "Rename `AgentKind` to `AgentType` across `src/` and `tests/`." Pure mechanical rewrite.

`codex-cli` — anti-example:
- "Design a provider-selection policy for the handoff launcher." Requires taste and judgment. Hand to `claude-code`.

`subagent` — matches:
- "List every file that imports `buildHandoffPrompt()` and group by directory." Discoverable, summary-shaped output.
- "Find all places where launch records are filtered by mission id and note which ones also read principle outcomes." Pure exploration.

`subagent` — anti-example:
- "Implement a new supervisor replacement across 12 files." Too large, too long-running. Hand to `claude-code`.

`claude-code` — matches:
- "Refactor `buildHandoffPrompt()` so mission and repository contexts share less duplicated logic." Architectural, multiple valid shapes.
- "Review the `codex-cli`-generated launch-store refactor from the previous milestone." Fresh instance, applies judgment.

`claude-code` — anti-example:
- "Add a trailing newline to `CHANGELOG.md`." Massive overkill. Hand to `codex-cli`.

`human` — matches:
- "Approve the final mission plan before handoff." Trust call.
- "Decide whether the auth rewrite ships in this mission or a follow-up." Scope and taste.

`human` — anti-example:
- "Write the actual middleware code." Humans are not the cheapest implementer. Hand to `codex-cli` or `claude-code` depending on ambiguity.
