# Step 15: Pre-Implementation Readiness Gate

**Progress: Step 15 of 16** -- Next: Feature Registration & Commit

## Goal
Validate that the spec and plan are aligned and complete before committing. Quick automated pass/fail check -- not a separate workflow.

## Execution Rules
- You MUST run ALL checks from `reference/readiness-gate.md`
- This is automated validation, not a conversation -- run checks and report results
- If gaps found, present options to user before proceeding
- Do NOT skip this step even when things look complete

## Context Boundaries
- spec.md and plan.md both written to disk
- Readiness gate checklist at `reference/readiness-gate.md`

## Gate Sequence

1. **Read Gate Checklist**
   Read `reference/readiness-gate.md` for the validation checks.

2. **Run Checks**
   Execute each check against spec.md and plan.md:

   a. **FR Coverage**: Parse FR references from spec, parse Addresses lines from plan. Every FR must appear in at least one task.

   b. **Acceptance Criteria Coverage**: Each AC in spec should map to a verifiable task or phase verification in plan.

   c. **Domain Requirements Coverage**: If spec has Domain Requirements section, verify each is addressed.

   d. **Dependency Sanity**: No circular dependencies, infrastructure before consumers.

   e. **Scope Alignment**: Plan tasks only cover MVP items. Growth/Vision items should not appear in plan.

3. **Report Results**
   Use the output format from readiness-gate.md:
   ```
   ## Readiness Gate Results

   [ok] FR Coverage: {n}/{total} FRs addressed
   [ok] Acceptance Criteria: {n}/{total} ACs mapped
   [ok] Domain Requirements: {n}/{total} covered (or N/A)
   [ok] Dependency Sanity: no circular dependencies
   [ok] Scope Alignment: plan covers MVP only

   --> READY: Proceed to feature registration and commit.
   ```

   Or if gaps found:
   ```
   [!] FR Coverage: {n}/{total} FRs addressed
       Missing: FR-7, FR-9

   --> GAPS FOUND: Resolve before proceeding.
   ```

4. **Handle Gaps**
   If gaps found, present options:
   - Add missing tasks to plan.md (re-run gate after)
   - Remove orphaned FRs from spec.md (re-run gate after)
   - Accept gaps and proceed anyway (note in feature.json)

   If user chooses to fix: update the relevant file, re-run gate.
   If user accepts gaps: note them and proceed.

## Quality Checks
- [ok] All 5 checks executed
- [ok] Results clearly reported with counts
- [ok] Gaps actionable (specific items listed, not vague)
- [ok] Gate re-run after any fixes

## When to Accept Imperfection

Not every gap is a blocker. Use this decision guide:

| Gap type | Blocking? | Action |
|----------|-----------|--------|
| Orphaned FR in MVP tier | Yes | Add a task or demote the FR to Growth |
| Orphaned FR in Growth/Vision tier | No | Acceptable -- these are future scope |
| AC without exact verification command | Yes | Write the command. "Manually verify" is not acceptable. |
| Domain requirement not in a task | Yes | Add a task or a `Must NOT do` guardrail |
| Minor dependency ordering issue | No | Note it, fix in plan, re-run gate |
| NFR without measurable threshold | Depends | If the NFR is MVP, add a number. If Growth, accept. |

**The principle**: MVP FRs and ACs must be fully covered. Growth/Vision items can be noted as future scope. The gate validates MVP completeness, not total completeness.

## Anti-patterns

| Anti-pattern | Why it fails | Fix |
|--------------|-------------|-----|
| Skipping the gate | Gaps in coverage ship silently | Always run, even when things look complete |
| Reporting "all good" without parsing | False confidence -- you did not actually check | Parse spec.md FR references, match against plan task Addresses lines |
| Not offering resolution options | User is stuck with a gap report and no path forward | Present: add task, remove FR, or accept with note |
| Proceeding past gaps without acknowledgment | Undocumented technical debt | User must explicitly accept any gap |
| Perfectionism -- refusing to pass with any Growth-tier gap | Design paralysis | Growth/Vision gaps are expected and acceptable |
