/**
 * Ingest a reply: match it to a feature, advance feature state when the
 * claimed outcome is consistent with objective reality (assertions), and
 * record principle outcomes for the handoff that gated this feature.
 *
 * Objective-first inference: `completed` is accepted only when feature is
 * in `review` with all assertions passed or waived. Any mismatch downgrades
 * the claim to a kickback and records the discrepancy in the result's
 * `downgradeReason`.
 *
 * Idempotent: `replyStore.isIngested(missionId, featureId)` short-circuits repeated
 * polls. Callers should wrap in try/catch; this usecase never mutates on
 * parse/validation failures.
