# maestro

Maestro is a local-first conductor for multi-agent software engineering. It gives you one CLI and one on-disk state model for missions, features, assertions, handoff launches, checkpoints, memory, and project context so separate agent sessions can collaborate without a server, database, or background daemon.

It is designed for a workflow where a human operator coordinates multiple terminals, while Maestro keeps the shared state disciplined and inspectable.

## Why Maestro

- Shared state lives on disk in `.maestro/`, not in chat history.
- Missions break work into milestones, features, and validation assertions.
- Native handoff launches build a self-contained markdown brief and start a fresh Codex or Claude run from the current repo state.
- Memory commands turn corrections and learnings into reusable guidance.
- Mission Control gives you a read-only TUI and JSON snapshots of current state.
- The runtime stays local-first: filesystem, git, config, and terminal tools.

## System Map

![Maestro system overview](assets/diagrams/readme-system-overview.svg)

Maestro is the shared state layer in the middle. The operator and fresh agent runs both go through the CLI, the CLI persists shared state locally, and Mission Control projects that same state without mutating it.

## What Maestro Is Not

- It is not a hosted orchestration service or remote agent platform.
- It is not tied to a single model vendor or harness.
- It does not require a database, queue, or network API to work.

The human operator is the bridge between terminals. Maestro is the shared state layer underneath that workflow.

## Two Working Loops

Maestro has two related but separate operating modes:

| Use missions when you need... | Use tasks when you need... |
|---|---|
| A planned multi-step effort with milestones, assertions, checkpoints, and handoff launches. | A lightweight blocker graph for the daily queue. |
| A durable brief for a fresh agent run. | Fast `ready`, `claim`, `update`, and blocker management. |
| Reviewable artifacts under `.maestro/missions/<mission-id>/`. | Repo-tracked task state under `.maestro/tasks/tasks.jsonl`. |

If you only remember one distinction: `mission` is for planned execution; `task` is for the day-to-day queue.

## Core Concepts

| Concept | Purpose |
|---|---|
| Mission | The top-level unit of work with a lifecycle such as `draft`, `approved`, or `executing`. |
| Milestone | A phase within a mission. Milestones can act as work phases or validation gates. |
| Feature | A concrete piece of work assigned to an agent type, with verification steps and optional dependencies. |
| Assertion | A validation target tied to a feature. Assertions are updated to `passed`, `failed`, `blocked`, or `waived`. |
| Handoff | A persisted launch record plus markdown brief for starting a fresh Codex or Claude session from current mission or repo context. |
| Task | A Claude-style blocker-graph work item for the daily loop; lives at `.maestro/tasks/tasks.jsonl` independent of missions. |
| Reply | A agent's structured outcome record for a feature, optionally gated by behavioral principles. |
| Principle | A behavioral rule injected into agent prompts and scored against replies. Stored at `.maestro/principles.jsonl`. |
| Memory | Corrections, learnings, and compiled guidance that feed back into future agent prompts. |
| Checkpoint | A timestamped mission snapshot you can save and later restore. |
| Bundle | A portable `.mission.tar.gz` archive of a mission plus its artifacts for review or transfer. |
| Mission Control | A read-only dashboard for previewing mission state interactively or as JSON. |

## Mission Control Preview

Mission Control gives you a read-only terminal dashboard over the current Maestro state.

## How Work Flows

![How Maestro work flows](assets/diagrams/readme-how-work-flows.svg)

The loop is deliberately simple: define work, optionally inspect the feature brief, launch a fresh handoff, update progress, validate the outcome, and checkpoint before sealing the milestone.

## Installation

### Requirements

- [Bun](https://bun.sh/)
- Git
- A local agent harness in another terminal, such as Claude Code, Codex, Gemini CLI, or Droid CLI

### Install From Release

Install the latest published Maestro binary:

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReinaMacCredy/maestro/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

Install a specific published release:

```bash
MAESTRO_VERSION=<version> curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ReinaMacCredy/maestro/main/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

After installation, refresh to the latest published release with:

```bash
maestro update
```

### Build From Source

```bash
bun install
bun run build
```

This produces the compiled binary at `./dist/maestro`.

### Install Locally

```bash
bun run release:local
command -v maestro
maestro --version
```

If you also want to initialize global config and inject supported agent instruction blocks:

```bash
maestro install
```

`./dist/maestro` is the fresh repo build. `maestro` on your `PATH` is the installed local binary.

## Quick Start

### 1. Initialize a project

```bash
maestro init
```

This creates the local `.maestro/` workspace for the current repository.

### 2. Create a mission plan file

`mission create` expects a JSON plan file. A minimal example:

```json
{
  "title": "Add authentication",
  "description": "Ship the first authentication slice",
  "milestones": [
    {
      "id": "plan",
      "title": "Planning",
      "description": "Define the implementation approach",
      "order": 0,
      "kind": "work",
      "profile": "planning"
    },
    {
      "id": "implement",
      "title": "Implementation",
      "description": "Build and verify the feature",
      "order": 1,
      "kind": "work",
      "profile": "implementation"
    }
  ],
  "features": [
    {
      "id": "auth-plan",
      "milestoneId": "plan",
      "title": "Plan the auth flow",
      "description": "Define the login shape, risks, and acceptance criteria",
      "agentType": "codex-cli",
      "verificationSteps": [
        "Review the proposed flow with the team"
      ]
    },
    {
      "id": "auth-impl",
      "milestoneId": "implement",
      "title": "Implement the auth flow",
      "description": "Build the first working authentication slice",
      "agentType": "codex-cli",
      "dependsOn": [
        "auth-plan"
      ],
      "verificationSteps": [
        "Run build",
        "Run targeted tests",
        "Verify the login flow manually"
      ],
      "fulfills": [
        "auth-login-works"
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

### 3. Create and approve the mission

```bash
maestro mission create --file plan.json
maestro mission list
maestro mission approve <mission-id>
```

### 4. Inspect the current feature brief (optional)

```bash
maestro feature list --mission <mission-id>
maestro feature prompt <feature-id> --mission <mission-id> --out agent-prompt.md
```

This writes the prompt to `agent-prompt.md` and also stores it under `.maestro/missions/<mission-id>/agents/<feature-id>/prompt.md`. `maestro handoff` does not require this step, but it is useful when you want to inspect the current feature context before launching a fresh agent run.

### 5. Launch a handoff

Launch a fresh Codex run for the next implementation slice:

```bash
maestro handoff \
  "Implement auth-impl for mission <mission-id> and run the listed verification steps before stopping" \
  --provider codex
```

Launches are detached by default. Maestro persists the handoff under `.maestro/launches/<id>/` and returns the launch record with the prompt path, log path, target directory, and provider details.

Useful variants:

```bash
maestro handoff "Review auth-impl before merge" --provider claude --worktree auth-review
maestro handoff "Finish auth-impl and wait for the result" --provider codex --wait --json
```

### 6. Track progress, validate, and seal

```bash
maestro feature update auth-impl --mission <mission-id> --status in-progress
maestro feature update auth-impl --mission <mission-id> --status review
maestro validate show --mission <mission-id>
maestro validate update auth-login-works --mission <mission-id> --result passed --evidence "bun test"
maestro checkpoint save --mission <mission-id>
maestro milestone seal implement --mission <mission-id>
```

## Handoffs

`maestro handoff "<task>"` builds a self-contained markdown brief and launches a fresh Codex or Claude run from the current repo state. Every launch is persisted under `.maestro/launches/<id>/` so the operator can inspect exactly what was sent and what the child process printed.

### What a launch contains

A launch record always includes:

- `id`, `provider`, and `model`
- `status`: `launching`, `launched`, `completed`, or `failed`
- `targetDir`: the directory handed to the external agent
- `promptPath`, `outputPath`, and the exact launched `command`
- optional `worktree` metadata when `--worktree` is used
- optional `pid` and `exitCode`, depending on detached vs `--wait` mode

The prompt itself is stored separately as markdown. Maestro always renders the same sections:

- `Task`
- `Context`
- `Relevant Files`
- `Current State`
- `What Was Tried`
- `Decisions`
- `Acceptance Criteria`
- `Constraints`

### How prompt context is chosen

- If exactly one actionable feature exists in the active mission, Maestro anchors the brief to that mission, milestone, feature, assertions, agent prompt or report artifacts, and the current git state.
- Otherwise it falls back to repository context: current branch, recent commits, and changed files.
- When `--worktree` is used, Maestro creates the sibling worktree first and appends that worktree path and branch information to the `Constraints` section.

### Launch status flow

![Launch status flow](assets/diagrams/readme-launch-status.svg)

- Default mode returns as soon as the child process is started and records status `launched`.
- `--wait` blocks until the provider exits and records `completed` or `failed`.
- `--json` prints the persisted launch record for automation or debugging.

Standalone diagram source: [`readme-launch-status.html`](assets/diagrams/readme-launch-status.html)

### Typical commands

Default Codex launch:

```bash
maestro handoff \
  "Implement auth-impl for mission <mission-id> and verify the touched surface area" \
  --provider codex
```

Claude launch in a sibling worktree:

```bash
maestro handoff \
  "Review auth-impl for regressions and missing tests" \
  --provider claude \
  --worktree auth-review
```

Foreground automation-friendly launch:

```bash
maestro handoff \
  "Finish auth-impl and return only after the tests pass" \
  --provider codex \
  --wait \
  --json
```

Use `--model` to override the provider default (`gpt-5.4` for Codex, `opus` for Claude), `--name` to label the launch, and `--base` when you need a specific base branch for a worktree handoff.

## Mission Control

Mission Control is a read-only dashboard over Maestro state. It supports:

- Interactive TTY mode with `maestro mission-control`
- Single-frame previews with `maestro mission-control --preview`
- Machine-readable snapshots with `maestro mission-control --json`
- Render validation with `maestro mission-control --render-check --size 120x40`

Available preview screens include:

- `dashboard`
- `features`
- `dependencies` (mission-only)
- `config`
- `memory`
- `graph`
- `agents`
- `dispatch` (mission-only)
- `events`
- `tasks`
- `timeline` (mission-only)
- `principles`
- `help`

Aliases: `feat`, `deps`, `cfg`, `mem`, `agent`, `event`, `task`, `principle`. Mission-only screens are skipped automatically when running in home mode.

For non-interactive environments, prefer `--preview`, `--preview all`, or `--json`.

## Architecture

![Maestro architecture layers](assets/diagrams/readme-architecture-layers.svg)

The codebase follows a hexagonal shape: commands stay thin, `src/services.ts` wires dependencies, use cases depend on domain rules and ports, and adapters implement those ports against the local filesystem and environment.

Standalone diagram source: [`readme-architecture-layers.html`](assets/diagrams/readme-architecture-layers.html)

## Storage Model

Maestro stores project-local state in `.maestro/` and user-level defaults in `~/.maestro/`.

| Surface | Lives where | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| Project workflow state | `.maestro/` | Missions, launches, tasks, notes, and local memory artifacts |
| User-level defaults | `~/.maestro/` | Global config and graph metadata |
| Read-only projections | Mission Control | Terminal previews and JSON snapshots over the same state |

```text
.maestro/
├── config.yaml
├── launches/
├── memory/
│   ├── corrections/
│   ├── learnings/
│   └── ratchet/
├── missions/
│   └── <mission-id>/
│       ├── mission.json

│   └── candidates/
├── principles.jsonl
└── notes.json

~/.maestro/
├── config.yaml
└── graph/
    └── projects.json
```

The design is intentionally transparent: state is inspectable, diffable, and easy to back up. `.maestro/tasks/**` and `.maestro/principles.jsonl` are intentionally repo-tracked so the daily queue and behavioral rules are reviewed like any other code change; `.maestro/missions/**` and `.maestro/launches/**` stay ignored as local orchestration artifacts. Legacy `.maestro/handoffs/**` folders can remain on disk, but Maestro no longer reads them and `status` or `doctor` will warn when they are present.

## Codebase Layout

Maestro is organized as a feature-first hexagonal codebase:

- `src/features/<name>/` -- each feature is a bounded context containing its own `commands/`, `usecases/`, `domain/`, `ports/`, `adapters/`, plus a `services.ts` composition factory and `index.ts` public surface. Current features: `ratchet`, `handoff` (markdown prompt building plus Codex or Claude launch orchestration), `notes`, `graph`, `session`, `memory`, `mission` (with `feature/`, `validation/`, `checkpoint/` subfolders and behavioral principles), `agent` (library-only; composes agent prompts and manages harness config injection), `task` (Claude-style blocker graph for the daily loop), `reply` (agent reply ingest with principle gating), and `bundle` (portable mission archive).
- `src/infra/` -- plumbing that isn't a feature: init, doctor, status, install, update, uninstall, and mission-control commands, config and git ports/adapters, and infra-owned domain types.
- `src/shared/` -- generic utilities with no domain knowledge: filesystem, YAML, shell, path safety, and output formatting under `lib/`; cross-cutting primitives like IDs and UI config under `domain/`; plus top-level `errors.ts`, `version.ts`, and `version-format.ts`.
- `src/tui/` -- read-only rendering and input for Mission Control; consumes features through their public surfaces. See `src/tui/README.md` for the contributor-oriented TUI architecture walkthrough.
- `src/services.ts` -- composition root that wires every feature's adapters into a single service object.
- `src/index.ts` -- Commander CLI entry point.

Cross-feature imports must go through `@/features/<name>`, which resolves to the feature's `index.ts`. Deep imports across feature boundaries are forbidden and enforced by `bun run check:boundaries` in CI. Two features have explicit, scoped exceptions:

- `agent` may import from `mission`, `memory`, and `handoff` through their public surfaces, because agent composes prompts from mission context, memory hints, and the native handoff launcher APIs.
- `bundle` may import from `mission`, `reply`, `handoff`, and `session` through their public surfaces, because bundle is a read-only aggregator that snapshots every mission artifact, including handoff launches, into a portable archive.

The runtime is intentionally narrow: filesystem-backed stores, git integration, config handling, and a terminal UI. There is no database adapter or network service in the main workflow.

## Development

```bash
bun run build
bun run typecheck
bun test
bun run tui:dev
bun run release:local
```

Useful verification commands for CLI and TUI work:

```bash
./dist/maestro --version
maestro --version
maestro --help
maestro mission-control --preview --size 120x40 --format plain
maestro mission-control --render-check --size 120x40
```

## Supported Agent Config Injection

`maestro install` and `maestro update` can inject instruction blocks for:

- Claude Code
- Codex
- Gemini CLI
- Droid CLI

These instruction blocks help each harness read and write shared Maestro state consistently.
